First to be able to run this main.rs rust file u will need to have install rust using this website https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust this will set u up perfectly with a mainrs. Build it with cargo build. After that you will run this command to build it rustc main.rs if it isnt under a folder if it is under a folder and you follow the website I posted it would be rustc src\main.rs should work since it will be in the src folder and this command to run it cargo run or .\main.exe

The run the specific problem codes make sure to follow that same format but copy the main.rs and their respective cargos for usage. FOr example for problem 1 you would have the main.rs under the src folder and the cargos outside of it and then you do the commands stated above to run and it should give you the result it gave us in the discussion post

First to be able to run this main.rs rust file u will need to have install rust using this website https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust this will set u up perfectly with a mainrs. Build it with cargo build. After that you will run this command to build it rustc main.rs if it isnt under a folder if it is under a folder and you follow the website I posted it would be rustc src\main.rs should work since it will be in the src folder and this command to run it cargo run or .\main.exe
